CHARLIE IS WHERE?
Charlie and Mary are in the garden.
The time is well today, it is very hot.
But yesterday it was very cold!
They can play outside not.
Charlie and Mary liked #prpers played, they played together always in the garden in front of the big house.
Charlie is the small boy and he is six year old.
The small girl he is his sibling, he is five year old.
Charlie is in the small dog, the dog is also in the garden now.
The dog like #prpers played in two children.
The dog is very in happy now.
Mary is also in the dog?
Not, Mary is in the dog not, he is in the cat.
But the cat is inside  the house, the cat he is sleeping.
their mother he is inside of the house in the cat, he looks in the window and he sees Charlie and Mary they are playing.
Charlie escapes quickly in the big tree of old, he is hiding Mary.
You know why?
Mary he is living and he is in his hands in front of his eyes.
He can see nothing and he is reading.
Why he is doing that?
And Charlie he is making what near  the tree?
It is the game.
When Mary finishes to read he looks around.
He is searching Charlie: *akeyi where? You see her?
Mary knows the site Charlie is not
He asks the dog: "You see Charlie?".
But the dog he can say not.
So Mary earns the answer of his question not.
The people earn the answer never when they talk to the dogs.
Mary looks his mother behind  the window, his mother he is laughing
Mary decides his mother he sees where Charlie *akendaki: "#Say me he is where!", he talks to his mother.
"Not Mary, I can know you not!", he replies.
Even he knows where he is, he refuses to say.
Mary advances slowly in the garden.
He is still to test to find Charlie.
He looks under  the table and under  the chairs, but Charlie is over there not.
He looks everywhere but he can find Charlie not.
So he hears the sound, it is coming behind  the big tree of old.
Enough to be Charlie? It is the sound again. He hears well.
It is the bird or other animal not. He can hear that well now.
It must be Charlie!
And he sees the small hand and when he advances close he sees also his person.
He laughs and he talks: "I see you!".
They are in happy and *kei in the house, it is the time  to eat something and to drink some the water!
