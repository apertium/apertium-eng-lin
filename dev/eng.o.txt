No, Mary is in the dog no, he is in the cat.
But the cat is inside  the house, the cat he is sleeping.

Charlie escapes quickly in the big tree of old, he is hiding Mary.
You know why?
Mary he is living and he is in his hands in front of his eyes.
He can see nothing and he is reading.
Why he is doing that?
And Charlie he is making what near  the tree?
It is the game.
When Mary finishes to read he looks around.
He is searching Charlie: *akeyi where? You see her?
Mary knows the site Charlie is no
He asks the dog: "You see Charlie?".
But the dog he can say no.
So Mary earns the answer of his question no.
The people earned the answer never when they talk to the dogs.
Mary looks his mother behind  the window, his mother he is laughing
Mary decides his mother he sees where Charlie *akendaki: "#Say me he is where!", he talks to his mother.
"No Mary, I can know you no!", he replies.
Even he knows where he is, he refuses to say.
Mary advances slowly in the garden.
He is still to test to find Charlie.
He looks under  the table and under  the chairs, but Charlie is over there no.
He looks everywhere but he can find Charlie no.
So he hears the sound, it is coming behind  the big tree of old.
It can be Charlie? It is the sound again. He hears well.
It is the bird or other animal no. He can hear that well now.

And he sees the small hand and when he advances close he sees also his person.
He laughs and he talks: "I see you!".
